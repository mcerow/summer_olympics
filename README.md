# Summer Olympics EDA

This repository includes a simple exercise in Exploratory Data Analyis around the Summer Olympics. I used a dataset found on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/the-guardian/olympic-games/data). While the dataset includes both Winter & Summer Olympic Medal Results, I decided to focus on the Summer Olympics as a means of exploring the data and answering some simple questions.

The libraries I used in this project are:

    - Pandas
    - Matplotlib
    - Seaborn
    
## Question 1: What country has won the most medals since 1986 in the Summer Games?
